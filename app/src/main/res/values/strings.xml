        Postpartum depression (PPD) \n is a form of clinical depression
        that affects women after giving birth.
        It typically occurs within \nthe first few weeks or months after delivery,
        although it can develop at any point during the first year after giving birth.
        PPD is different from the "baby blues," which is a mild, temporary
        mood disorder that many women experience after giving birth.\n\n\n
        PPD is characterized by feelings of \n
        sadness, hopelessness, guilt, and worthlessness,
        as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue,\n
        sleep disturbances, and appetite changes.
        Other symptoms may include irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating,
        and thoughts of self-harm or harming the baby.\n
        PPD can make it difficult for women to bond with their babies.\n\n\n
        PPD is a serious condition that requires medical attention,
        and it can be treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n
        It\'s important for women to seek help
        if they\'re experiencing symptoms of PPD,
        as early treatment can\n
        help improve outcomes for both
        the mother and the baby.\n\n\n
